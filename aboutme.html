        <p class="pstory">Once upon a time there was a girl named Ann.  She loved animals, so after high school she set off for the University of Georgia to become a veterinarian.  While she was at school, she learned about other degree programs and starting taking art classes.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pstory">  At the end of the year, she passed a portfolio review and was accepted into the art school.  She still wanted to be a veterinarian, so she continued taking biology classes too.  She also found a job in a lab on campus, prepping samples and cleaning glassware.  She was having a great time and learned a lot.</p>

        <p class="pstory">After three years at school, life took a turn for Ann.  For family reasons, she had to leave school and set out to find a job.  Luckily, she found Biotech, Inc. where she was offered an entry-level, full time job.  The hours were long, but Ann enjoyed her work.  Biotech, Inc. made products that helped people across the globe.  Ann worked hard and started moving up the corporate ladder.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pstory">
          She also returned to school and completed a degree in Biology.

        <p class="pstory">Time can go by quickly, and before she knew it 12 years had passed by.  Most of the years were good, but working for Biotech, Inc. was never easy.  Even the smallest mistake can be a big deal and every decision is closely scrutinized.  It’s a necessary part of the business, but after time it can wear a person down.  Ann began to explore other careers and learned about web development and design.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pstory">It was around this time that Ann’s husband Jimmy was offered a great job, but it was on the other side of the country.  Ann and Jimmy decided the time was right and Ann bid farewell to all her friends at Biotech, Inc.  They packed up their things, tossed the dog in the car and headed west.</p>
